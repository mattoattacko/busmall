Things to focus on:
1. We need an array of images for users to click on. 
2. These will be in the /img folder.
3. We need a constructor funtion for products
4. We need an event listener so we can click on the image, this should be recorded to the document probably
5. We need to make sure the user can click on any image they want, multiple times, up to 25. Then the code should stop the user from being able to click on things any further.
6. We need to randomize the images.
7. We need a vote counter (can add to constructor func)
8. We need a view counter (can add to constructor func)
9. We need to display the list of what the user clicked on w/ DOM manipulation
10. We need to make sure the images do not repeat within the same single display of images.
11. Append the DOM
