Things to focus on:
1. As a programmer I will need an array of images for users to click on. 
    * These will be in the /img folder.
2. As a programmer I will need a constructor funtion for the products.
3. As the company trying to get the marketing information from our website, I will need to have something that records what the user clicks on. 
4. As a programmer, We need an event listener so we can click on the image, this should probably be recorded to the document.
5. As a designer, I need to make sure the user can click on any image they want, multiple times, up to 25. Then the code should stop the user from being able to click on things any further.
6. As a programmer I will need to randomize the images repeatedly so that I have a better overall idea of the products the users may want. Displaying random images with a robust enough image_container should allow our users to see as many products as possible. 
7. As a marketing company, I want to know how many votes each product is getting. We should use a vote counter 
    * We can add to constructor funcntion.
8. As a programmer I will need a view counter to know that if the data I'm getting from the image clicks is as randomized as I hope it is, and to know if a product image is not working.
    * We can add to constructor function.
9. As a programmer I need to display the list of what the user clicked on w/ DOM manipulation
10. As a designer I need to make sure the images do not repeat within the same single display set of images.
11. As a programmer I need to append the DOM so things work.
